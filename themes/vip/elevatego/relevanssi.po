Indexing is a heavy task and might take more time than your servers allow. If the indexing cannot be finished - for example you get a blank screen or something like that after indexing - you can continue indexing from where you left by clicking 'Continue indexing'. Clicking 'Build the index' will delete the old index, so you can't use that."
