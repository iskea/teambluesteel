= Using Features =

**Chrome Notifications**
To use notifications in Chrome just activate the plugin and sign into your Roost account, we take care of the rest. The necessary files are dynamically generated upon request, eliminating the need to upload additiona files or potentially change diretory permissions. If you're curious, for detailed information view our [Chrome Integration Guide](https://goroost.com/best-practices/chrome-integration-guide).

**Safari Push Notifications**
To use Safari Web Push, simply activate the Roost plugin. No additional setup is needed.

**Category Filters**
With *Auto Push* enabled, you can select which categories are excluded from triggering notifications.

**Notifications on Updates**
A checkbox is now displayed above the *Publish* button when updating posts. If you want to send a notification when updating, just put a tick in the box. Easy.

**Notification Prompt Control**
Control how and when you display the subscription prompt to your site visitors. From the settings tab, you can set a minimum number of visits, or create a link or button to trigger the prompt. When a button or link is used, if the browser is not able to receive push notifications, we will automatically hide the link or button.

**Custom Notification Headlines**
Use custom text for your notification headline by setting it underneath the standard post content. If you set a custom headline, it will be used for your notification. Not setting a headline will default to your post title.

**Auto Push**
Auto Push is what makes this plugin stellar. When you create a new post, your post's title, link, and featured image (if one is attached) will be sent to all of your subscribed readers. That's it. Really. You don't have to do anything else. (It works just like magic.) When enabled, an auto push override check box is also placed on your post's admin page. If for some reason you do not want a notification to go out for that post, just check the box when publishing.

**Manual Post Mode**
With *Auto Push* disabled, a checkbox will appear just above the Publish button on your post page. Simply check the box *Send Notification with Roost* and a notification will be sent when publishing.

**Send Manual Alert**
You can send a manual notification to all subscribed users by entering your message text in the "Notification Text" box and a link in the "Notification Link" box.

**Roost Analytics & Roost JS**
Detailed metrics are provided in the dashboard. These metrics include subscribes, notifications sent, reads, and more.

**Advanced Settings - Use Segmented Send**
Use WordPress categories to target notifications based on Roost segments. ***DISCLAIMER*** You must be assigning users segments to send notifications. If not, notificaitons will not be sent to your subscribers.

**Advanced Settings - Use Custom Script**
In some cases, weâ€™ll ask you to use a custom script. Paste it in the text area shown. (Enabling this feature will not include the normal Roost.js)
