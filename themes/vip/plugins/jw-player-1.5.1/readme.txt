== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin replace the old JW Player Plugin for WordPress? =

Yes, it does. You cannot run both plugins at the same time. However, you can import your referenced media, your players and your playlists from the old plugin into your JW Player account.

= Does this plugin work with caching solutions like WP-Supercache? =

Yes, it does. However, you should disable the signing functionality of the
plugin, since the caching might interfere with the signing timeout logic. Simply
go to Settings > JW Player and set the signing timeout to 0.

Yes, you can. In order to do this, simply write "pl:" (without the quotes) in front of your search query in the widget.
